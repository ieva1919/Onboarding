# Slider

## Goal:

Create a slider component which would automatically cycle slides.

## Requirements

- Slider class implements only the logic that is required to control the index of current slide, while DOMSlider extends that class and implements slider DOM elements manipulation.
- All tests in Slider.spec.js must pass.
- Slide thumnbnails need to be generated from slides that are defined in HTML.
- Slides may have different content.
- Previous and next slide buttons need to switch slides accordingly.
- Smaller resolution devices need to load smaller resolution images.
